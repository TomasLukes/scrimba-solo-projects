# Tenzies

Tenzies is my first React app from the Scrimba course that I wanted to share. It's a dice-based game where the objective is to roll all dice to display the same number. In the game, the player can:
- Make an initial roll with all new dice
- Click to hold a die's value for the next round
- Remove the hold attribute from a die by clicking it again
- Roll new dice with each turn
- Win the game when all dice have the same value

## What I Learned

As this was my first deployed React app, I learned:
- Setting up a React project with Vite
- Understanding JSX and its syntax
- Applying basic React concepts such as components and passing props, as well as hooks like useState and useEffect
- Adapting and modifying design elements from a Figma file
- Creating a single-page application with more complex logic

## Future Improvements

Having created a minimum viable product, I aim to add stretch goals and learn new skills:
- Implementing Tailwind CSS for styling
- Adding a timer to track how quickly a player wins
- Recording the best times a player achieves
