# Movie Search App - React

After creating the same app with vanilla JS and CSS, I wanted to refactor it using React to compare the development process with and without a framework. Movie Search is an app where users can:
- Search for movie titles
- Add movies to the watchlist
- Remove movies from the watchlist
- Store the watchlist in localStorage
- Watch items saved in the watchlist

## What I Learned

This was my first multi-page React app, where I had the opportunity to:
- Manage app routing using React Router 6
- Compare the process of developing the same project with basic JS and CSS, and see the benefits that React offers
- Learn how to prepare a project for later refactoring and scaling (since I used an older basic version of this app)

## Future Improvements

After fully refactoring the app to React and implementing routing, I plan to continue development by:
- Using more advanced styling techniques (Tailwind or Sass)
- Creating a more robust solution for storing the watchlist (Firebase)
- Adding user authentication (Firebase?)
